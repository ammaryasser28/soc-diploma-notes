# 🔥 What is a Firewall?

A **Firewall** is:

> The gatekeeper of the network  

It stands between:

- **Internal Network**  
- **Internet (External Network)**

Any traffic going in or out **must pass through it**.

---

## 🌐 Firewall Placement in a Network

### 1️⃣ Perimeter Firewall
The main firewall, located between:

- Company network  
- Internet

**Purpose:** Protect the company from external attacks.

### 2️⃣ Internal Firewalls
Why use them?

- Segment different departments  
  Example: HR network vs Marketing network

**Benefits:**

- Protect sensitive data  
- Reduce attack spread  
- Apply the **Least Privilege** principle  

> Example: If a Marketing device is infected, the attack won’t easily reach HR.

## 🧱 Does a Firewall block traffic by itself?
❌ No  
A firewall is **dumb without rules**  

You must define:

- What is allowed?  
- What is denied?

---

## 📜 Firewall Rules

A rule defines:

- Traffic type (TCP / UDP / ANY)  
- Source  
- Destination  
- Port  
- Action (Allow / Deny)

### 🚫 Default Behavior
Most firewalls use:  

**DENY ALL by default**  
> Anything not explicitly allowed ❌ is blocked  

This is the safest approach.

---

## 👨‍💻 Who creates the rules?
**Network Security Team**  

But as a **SOC Analyst**:

- You need to understand the rules  
- Read and interpret them  
- Analyze alerts generated by them  

---

## 🖥️ Configuring Rules
Usually via a GUI, but:

> A small mistake = big problem  
> Wrong rule = potential breach or service outage

---

## 🧪 Rule Examples

1. ✅ `ALLOW TCP Internal_Network → Internet PORTS 80, 443`  
   **Meaning:** Allow company devices to browse HTTP/HTTPS  

2. ❌ `DENY ANY Internet → Internal_Network`  
   **Meaning:** Block any incoming traffic from the Internet  

3. ❌ `DENY TCP ANY → ANY PORT 21`  
   **Meaning:** Block FTP (unencrypted and insecure)  

4. ❌ `DENY IP Country_List → Internal_Network`  
   **Meaning:** Block connections from certain countries (geo-based attacks)  

5. ❌ `DENY UDP Internal_Network → ANY PORT 53`  
   **Meaning:** Block DNS over UDP (prevent DNS Tunneling or enforce internal DNS use only)  

---

## 🔄 Default Allow vs Default Deny

- 🛑 **Default Deny:** Block everything except what is explicitly allowed → **more secure ✅**  
- 🟢 **Default Allow:** Allow everything except what is explicitly blocked → less secure ❌  

> Knowing this is critical during incident investigations.

---

## 🎯 Why Firewalls Matter for SOC Analysts

- Understand network traffic  
- Analyze alerts  
- Determine if behavior is normal or malicious  
- Track: Source, Destination, Ports, Protocols  

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Firewall = Gatekeeper  
- Won’t function without rules  
- Rules define allow and deny traffic  
- There are external and internal firewalls  
- Default Deny is the safest configuration  
- Understanding rules is a key skill for any SOC Analyst
