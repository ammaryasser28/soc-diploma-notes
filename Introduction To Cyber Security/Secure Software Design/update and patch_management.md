---

## 📌 Overview
Keeping your operating system and applications up-to-date is crucial for both **security** and **stability**.  
Not all updates add features or fix bugs; some are **critical security patches** that prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities, including **zero-day threats**.

## 🎯 Updates and Patches

### Importance of Updates
- Enable automatic updates on personal devices whenever possible
- Security updates must be prioritized
- Zero-day vulnerabilities require immediate patching to prevent attacks
- Windows allows automatic installation of **important updates**, which is safe and recommended

## 🛡 Patch Management

### What is Patch Management?
- A system to **organize, approve, and deploy updates** efficiently, especially in large organizations
- Prevents network congestion caused by all devices downloading updates independently
- Allows testing updates before widespread deployment to avoid system instability

### Key Points
- Large organizations (1,000+ devices) require **centralized patch management**
- Testing updates ensures stability and reduces risk of crashes
- Helps ensure updates are installed safely and on schedule

## 🔑 Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)

### What is WSUS?
- WSUS = **Windows Server Update Services**
- Microsoft solution for **centralized patch management**
- Allows administrators to **approve and control updates** for all devices in a network

2. WSUS server downloads updates and stores them centrally
3. Administrators approve updates before deployment
4. Only approved updates are sent to endpoints

### Benefits
- Full control over updates
- Reduces risk of unstable systems
- Minimizes network congestion
- Suitable for large organizations
- Ensures tested updates are applied safely
