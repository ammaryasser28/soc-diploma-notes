# 🛡 OS Hardening

---

## 📌 Overview
**OS Hardening** is the process of **securing an operating system by reducing its attack surface**.  
The goal is to minimize the number of entry points that attackers can exploit, making the system safer and more resilient.

**Attack Surface**: All possible points where an attacker could try to access, interact with, or exploit a system.

Reducing this surface is the essence of OS hardening.

## 🎯 Key OS Hardening Techniques

### 1️⃣ Remove Unnecessary Accounts
- Delete unused or unwanted user accounts
- Accounts not in use can become security risks if compromised

---

### 2️⃣ Apply Strong Password Policies
- Minimum length (e.g., 12+ characters)
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Prevent weak or reused passwords

---

### 3️⃣ Restrict Remote Access
- Allow remote access only through **encrypted channels** (SSH, VPN)
- Avoid insecure protocols like Telnet
- Limit remote access to only authorized users

---

### 4️⃣ Limit Access to Critical Assets
- Only concerned users should access sensitive files or resources
- Example:
  - Password files → Admin only
  - System configuration files → Authorized personnel only

---

### 5️⃣ Remove Unnecessary Software and Services
- Delete programs and services that are not required, even if legitimate
- Each unnecessary service is a potential attack vector

---

## 🛠 Benefits of OS Hardening
- Reduces attack surface
- Minimizes vulnerabilities
- Protects sensitive data and system integrity
- Enhances overall system security and reliability

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
**OS Hardening is about minimizing potential points of attack.**  
A hardened OS is more secure, stable, and resistant to attacks.  
It involves:
- Deleting unused accounts
- Enforcing strong passwords
- Limiting access
- Removing unnecessary software and services
