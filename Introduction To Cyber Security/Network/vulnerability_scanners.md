# Vulnerability Scanners – Fundamentals

## 📌 What is a Vulnerability Scanner?
A **Vulnerability Scanner** is a security tool used to identify **known weaknesses**
in a target system by analyzing:

- Operating System
- Running services
- Application versions
- Missing patches
- Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)

In short:
> A vulnerability scanner identifies **what is running**, **its version**, and **whether it is vulnerable**.

---

## 🔗 Relationship with Port Scanning
Vulnerability scanning always comes **after port scanning**.

### Attack Flow:
1. **Port Scanning**
   - Identify open ports
   - Identify running services

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Identify OS and service versions
   - Check for known vulnerabilities

📌  
- Port Scanner answers: **What is open?**  
- Vulnerability Scanner answers: **Is what’s open vulnerable?**

---

## 🔍 How Vulnerability Scanners Work

### 🔹 Step 1: OS and Service Identification
The scanner attempts to identify:
- Target Operating System (Linux / Windows)
- Application listening on each open port
- Application version

Example:
```
Port: 80
Service: Apache
Version: 2.4.49
OS: Linux
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Version and Patch Analysis
The scanner compares detected versions against:
- Known vulnerable versions
- Missing security patches
- Misconfigurations

This comparison is done using **vulnerability databases**.

---

## 🆔 What is CVE?
**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** is a standardized identifier
assigned to publicly known vulnerabilities.

Example:
```
CVE-2021-41773
```

Each CVE provides:
- Vulnerability description
- Affected systems and versions
- Severity level
- Technical details

---

## 📊 Vulnerability Scan Results
After scanning, the tool generates a report including:
- Operating System
- Service name
- Service version
- Vulnerability ID (CVE)
- Severity level (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

---

## 💥 Attacker’s Next Step – Exploitation
Once a CVE is identified, the attacker will:

1. Copy the CVE ID
2. Search for it in **Exploit Database (Exploit DB)**
3. Look for:
   - Ready-to-use exploit code
   - Proof of Concept (PoC)

📌 If a working exploit exists, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly.

---

## 🧪 Example Scenario
```
Open Port: 21
Service: FTP
Version: vsFTPd 2.3.4
```
Scanner Result:
```
Vulnerable → CVE-2011-2523
```

Attacker Action:
- Search CVE in Exploit DB
- Find available exploit
- Gain unauthorized access (Shell)

---

## 🛠 Common Vulnerability Scanners

### Popular Tools:
- Nessus
- OpenVAS
- Nexpose
- Nmap (NSE Vulnerability Scripts)

📌 These tools are used by both:
- Attackers (Offensive Security)
- Defenders (Defensive Security)

The difference is **intent**, not the tool itself.

---

## 🔐 Defensive Perspective
From a defensive standpoint, vulnerability scanners help:
- Identify weak points before attackers do
- Patch vulnerable services
- Reduce attack surface
- Enforce security best practices

---

## 🧠 Summary
- Vulnerability scanners extend port scanning results
- They identify OS, services, versions, and CVEs
- CVE is a universal vulnerability identifier
- Exploit DB contains exploitation code for CVEs
- Vulnerability scanners do **not exploit** systems
  - They only **identify weaknesses**
