# IoT Devices and Their Security

## Overview
The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an essential part of our daily lives. From smart TVs and smart speakers to garage sensors that automatically close doors, IoT devices are everywhere. However, with this massive expansion comes serious security challenges.

Currently, there are more than **75 billion IoT devices** deployed worldwide, many of which suffer from weak or inconsistent security practices.

## IoT Devices and Security Challenges

- IoT devices include:
  - Smart speakers
  - Smart TVs
  - Smart home sensors (e.g., garage door sensors)
- These devices are widely deployed across homes, companies, and critical environments.

### Lack of Security Standards
- There are **no unified global security standards** for IoT devices.
- Only security proposals and recommendations exist.
- Each manufacturer implements security differently.

### Security Levels
- Some IoT devices are very secure.
- Others have little to no security at all.
- Many manufacturers stop providing updates after a short period, leaving devices vulnerable in the future.

## Critical Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices

### ShellShock Vulnerability
- **ShellShock** is a serious vulnerability that affected the **Bash shell** on Linux operating systems.
- Around **80% of IoT devices run Linux**, which means a massive number of devices were vulnerable.
- Devices that were built and deployed without future updates remain vulnerable unless manually patched.

---

## Manufacturer Priorities and Security Impact

- The primary goal of many companies is **profit**, not long-term security.
- This results in:
  - Minimal hardware capabilities
  - Weak or outdated encryption algorithms
  - Older Bluetooth versions with known vulnerabilities
- Some devices are released with **no future update plans**.
- Users are often required to manually update devices, if updates exist at all.

### Root Cause
- There are **no enforced regulations or standards** forcing manufacturers to maintain long-term security updates.

## Network Attacks

### Why Understanding Normal Behavior Matters
- Most cybersecurity studies focus on understanding **normal network behavior**.
- Knowing how systems work correctly helps in identifying abnormal or malicious activity.

### Detection Strategy
- Learn how devices and networks operate under normal conditions.
- Monitor for deviations from normal behavior.
- Abnormal patterns often indicate:
  - Network attacks
  - Compromised IoT devices
  - Malicious activities

## Conclusion

- IoT devices are rapidly increasing in number and usage.
- Security across these devices is inconsistent and often weak.
- Lack of updates and standards makes IoT devices prime targets for attackers.
- Understanding normal network behavior is essential for detecting network attacks.
- Stronger regulations and security standards are needed to improve IoT security in the future.
