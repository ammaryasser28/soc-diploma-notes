## Phishing

### Definition
- Phishing is a **mass attack** sent to a large number of users.
- It does not target a specific individual.
- Attackers rely on probability — even a small success rate is enough.

### Common Examples
- Emails claiming that a bank account has been suspended.
- Messages asking users to verify login credentials.
- SMS or messaging app links pretending to be legitimate services.

## Spear Phishing

### Definition
- Spear Phishing is a **targeted and more advanced** form of phishing.
- It focuses on a **specific individual**, usually someone in an important or privileged position.
- The attacker studies the victim in detail before launching the attack.

### Targeting Techniques
- Analyzing social media profiles
- Understanding job roles and responsibilities
- Mimicking trusted senders such as managers or IT staff

## Attack Techniques

### Fake Websites (Credential Harvesting)
- Attackers create fake websites that closely resemble legitimate services.
- Examples include:
  - Banking websites
  - Email providers
  - Social media platforms
- Victims are tricked into entering usernames and passwords.
- Credentials are then captured by the attacker.

### Malicious Links and Malware Delivery
- Emails or messages may contain malicious links.
- Clicking the link can:
  - Download malware onto the victim’s device
  - Compromise system security
- In many cases, the victim is unaware that an infection has occurred.

## Tools Used in Phishing Attacks

- There are **free and publicly available tools** that can:
  - Generate phishing pages
  - Craft deceptive messages
- This makes phishing attacks easy to execute, even by low-skilled attackers.
