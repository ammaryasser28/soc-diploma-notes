# Types of Malware

Malware (Malicious Software) refers to any software designed to harm systems,
steal data, disrupt operations, or provide unauthorized access.

This document explains the most common types of malware in a clear and simple way.

## 🦠 Virus

A **Virus** is malware that attaches itself to legitimate executable files and spreads
when the infected file is executed.

### Key Characteristics
- Requires **user interaction** (opening a file or running a program)
- Attaches to legitimate executables (e.g., `notepad.exe`)
- Can stay **resident in memory** even after closing the infected program
- Spreads by infecting other executables
- Causes:
  - Data corruption
  - System instability
  - Performance degradation

📌 Similar to a biological virus: infect → replicate → spread

## 🐛 Worm

A **Worm** is a self-replicating malware that spreads automatically across networks
without user interaction.

### Key Characteristics
- Does **not** require user interaction
- Independent executable (does not attach to other files)
- Exploits system or network vulnerabilities
- Scans networks and infects vulnerable machines
- Spreads extremely fast
- Causes:
  - Network congestion
  - Bandwidth consumption
  - System crashes

📌 Think of a worm as an automated vulnerability scanner with malicious intent.

## 🐴 Trojan (Trojan Horse)

A **Trojan** is malware disguised as legitimate software such as games, installers,
or email attachments.

### Key Characteristics
- Requires the user to install or run it
- Appears legitimate but contains malicious code
- Commonly used to:
  - Install backdoors
  - Download additional malware
  - Spy on the victim
- Most modern cyberattacks begin with a Trojan

---

## 🔐 Ransomware

**Ransomware** encrypts files and demands payment in exchange for decryption.

### Key Characteristics
- Uses strong encryption (cannot be reversed without a key)
- Common infection vectors:
  - Phishing emails
  - RDP compromises
- Can shut down entire organizations
- Best protection:
  - Regular offline backups

---

## 🕵️ Spyware

**Spyware** secretly monitors user activity without consent.

### Common Capabilities
- Keylogging (recording keystrokes)
- Screen recording
- Browser tracking
- Credential stealing
- Account hijacking

⚠️ Note: Many antivirus solutions detect spyware poorly.

🛡️ Specialized tools such as **Spybot** and anti-spyware software are more effective.

## 📢 Adware

**Adware** displays unwanted advertisements such as popups and redirects.

### Key Characteristics
- Often bundled with free software
- Usually less destructive
- Can slow down systems
- May lead to more serious malware infections

---

## 🥷 Rootkit

A **Rootkit** hides itself and other malware on a system.

### Key Characteristics
- Operates at low system levels (kernel or boot sector)
- Provides persistent and hidden access
- Extremely difficult to detect and remove
- Often requires full system reinstallation

---

## 🚪 Backdoor

A **Backdoor** provides hidden remote access to a system without authentication.

### Key Characteristics
- Often installed by Trojans
- Allows attackers to:
  - Execute commands
  - Steal data
  - Deploy additional malware

---

## 🧠 Fileless Malware

**Fileless Malware** operates without storing files on disk.

### Key Characteristics
- Resides in memory (RAM)
- Uses legitimate system tools (e.g., PowerShell, WMI)
- Hard to detect by traditional antivirus
- Leaves little to no forensic evidence
- Common in modern APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attacks

---

## 🤖 Botnet

A **Botnet** is a network of compromised devices controlled by a botmaster.

### Common Uses
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Sending spam emails
- Deploying ransomware or other malware

📌 Infected devices act as bots without the owner’s knowledge.
