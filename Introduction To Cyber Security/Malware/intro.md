# Malware Growth and Delivery Methods

## 📈 Malware Evolution Over Time

The number of malicious software programs (malware) has increased dramatically over the past decades:

- **1990**: Around **1,300** known malware samples
- **2000**: Approximately **50,000** malware samples
- **2010**: More than **200 million** malware samples
- **Today**: The number continues to grow exponentially

### Why Has Malware Increased So Rapidly?
- Widespread internet usage
- Ease of malware development
- Availability of ready-made malware kits
- Financial motivation (data theft, ransomware, fraud)
- Low security awareness among users

## 🚚 How Do Attackers Deliver Malware?

Attackers use multiple delivery channels, but some are far more common than others.

---

## 📧 Email-Based Malware Delivery (Most Common)

Email is the **primary method** used to distribute malware.

### Common Techniques:
- Malicious attachments:
  - PDF files
  - Microsoft Word or Excel documents
  - ZIP or compressed files
- Embedded malicious links
- Phishing emails impersonating:
  - Banks
  - Companies
  - Technical support teams

📌 **Why Email Is Effective**
- Trusted communication medium
- Relies on social engineering
- Targets the weakest link: the user

👉 **This is why email systems must be closely monitored.**

## 🌐 Malicious Domains and Websites

Malware can also be delivered through:
- Visiting malicious websites
- Downloading pirated or cracked software
- Clicking infected advertisements (Malvertising)

⚠️ In some cases:
- Simply visiting a website is enough
- Malware may download silently in the background

---

## 🎯 Why These Methods Work
- Users often trust emails and familiar-looking websites
- Fake domains closely mimic legitimate ones
- Attackers exploit curiosity, urgency, and fear

---

## 💥 Potential Impact
- Data theft
- Ransomware attacks
- Full system compromise
- Botnet enrollment
- Bypassing security controls

Because malware often runs inside **legitimate applications**, operating systems may treat malicious activity as normal behavior.

---

## 🛡️ Basic Protection Measures
- Email filtering and sandboxing
- Avoid opening unknown attachments or links
- Verify domain names before visiting websites
- Keep antivirus software updated
- User security awareness training

---

## 🧠 Summary
- Malware growth has been exponential
- Email is the most common malware delivery method
- Malicious domains are also widely used
- Effective defense requires both technology and user awareness
