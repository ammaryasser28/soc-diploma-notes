# Malware Detection Techniques

Modern malware detection relies on multiple techniques working together to
identify known, modified, and unknown threats. This document explains the
three primary detection methods used by antivirus and endpoint security
solutions.

## 🛡️ Detection Techniques Overview

Malware detection techniques can be divided into three main categories:

1. Signature-Based Detection  
2. Heuristic-Based Detection  
3. Behavior-Based Detection  

Each technique has strengths and weaknesses, which is why modern security
solutions combine them.

## 1️⃣ Signature-Based Detection

### What Is It?
Signature-based detection identifies malware by comparing files against
a database of known malware signatures.

### How It Works
- The antivirus calculates a hash (e.g., **MD5**, **SHA-256**) for an executable file
- It compares this hash with known malware hashes stored in its database
- It also checks:
  - Unique code patterns
  - Distinct strings extracted by malware analysts
- If a match is found → 🚨 Malware detected
- If no match is found → ✅ File marked as clean

### Key Characteristics
- Detects malware **before execution**
- Relies heavily on frequent database updates
- Antivirus databases are updated every few minutes

### Advantages
- Fast detection
- Low system resource usage
- Very low false positives

### Limitations
- Cannot detect new or unknown malware
- Ineffective against:
  - Zero-day malware
  - Modified malware
  - Fileless malware

📌 Signature-based detection alone is not sufficient for modern threats.

## 2️⃣ Heuristic-Based Detection

### What Is It?
Heuristic detection analyzes a program’s structure and logic to identify
suspicious behavior even if the malware is previously unknown.

### How It Works
- Examines:
  - Code structure
  - Instruction patterns
  - Suspicious API calls
- Flags programs that behave similarly to known malware

### Detection Timing
- Before execution
- Or during early stages of execution

### Advantages
- Can detect:
  - Modified malware
  - Unknown malware variants
- More flexible than signature-based detection

### Limitations
- Medium false positive rate
- Moderate system performance impact

---

## 3️⃣ Behavior-Based Detection

### What Is It?
Behavior-based detection monitors program activity **during runtime** to
identify malicious behavior.

### How It Works
- Observes actions such as:
  - File encryption
  - Process injection
  - Registry modification
  - Network communication with command-and-control servers
- Detects malware based on what it **does**, not what it looks like

### Advantages
- Effective against:
  - Zero-day malware
  - Fileless malware
  - Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Very difficult for attackers to bypass

### Limitations
- Higher system resource usage
- Medium to high false positives
- Requires advanced tools (e.g., EDR solutions)

## 🔍 Comparison Table

| Technique | What It Analyzes | Detection Timing | Dependency on Updates | Performance Impact |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Signature-Based | Known malware signatures | Before execution | Very High | Low |
| Heuristic-Based | Code structure and logic | Before / During execution | Medium | Medium |
| Behavior-Based | Runtime behavior | During execution | Low | High |

## 🧠 Modern Anti-Malware Approach

A mature organization does **not** rely solely on signature-based detection.

Modern security solutions combine:
- Signature-based detection
- Heuristic analysis
- Behavior monitoring
- Machine learning techniques

This layered approach enables detection of:
- Known malware
- Modified malware
- Newly created and zero-day malware

---

## 🛡️ Common Tools and Technologies
- Traditional Antivirus (e.g., ClamAV)
- Heuristic AV Engines
- EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
- Sandboxing systems

---

## 🧠 Summary
- Signature-based detection is fast but limited
- Heuristic detection adds intelligence
- Behavior-based detection provides the strongest protection
- Combining all techniques offers the best defense against modern malware
